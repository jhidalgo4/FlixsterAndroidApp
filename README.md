### Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Youtube API Key gave me trouble when having to connect to the Google servers, the youtube API key is set as a string that may have to be updated because of the Youtube API KEY inroder to play the video player may change over time.

### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app...
-When building the app, I need to use Async HTTP to recieve information from websites to fill my recyclerView. I used an API given, the issue would be would I need to make my own API key or can I continue to use the one CodePath gave, this is important to know if building off this same project. All functionally for app required works.
